CHANGING COLOR
there are two basic ways to apply custom coloring to residues: #1050
	write a custom theme that takes the coloring data as params (example https://github.com/molstar/molstar/blob/a1e2b0e5aec4d92fe84fcf8e6bfe1f08cdc08a29/src/extensions/pdbe/structure-quality-report/color.ts#L44)
	use the overpaint mechainsm, which allows you to color representations using a selection (starting point: https://github.com/molstar/molstar/blob/a1e2b0e5aec4d92fe84fcf8e6bfe1f08cdc08a29/src/mol-plugin-state/helpers/structure-overpaint.ts#L21-L22)

the primary purpose of overpaint is to easily paint over any existing color theme
in many cases a theme can be used to change a representation's color, but overpaint offers a second path for coloring that does not need to know about any themes, existing or future ones.

if we want to change the color of the representation: #68
	add { type: ..., color: "uniform", colorParams: Color(0xFFFF00) }
if we want to change the color of residues, we need to write a specific theme #462
	also check #1050
if we want to have different colors, instead of changing the default selection color, use overpaint #233

OVERPAINT
overpainting range of residues #664
overpaint NO se puede usar para cambiar opacidad con base en selecciones #149

reverting color after overpaint 
overpaint always overwrites any theme. If you want to revert that, you need to query the treee (e.g. using state.data.selectQ) and delete the nodes

CUSTOM COLOR THEME VIA CustomElementProperty
https://github.com/molstar/molstar/discussions/146

EXTRACTING THEME USED BY A STRUCTURE
	this.plugin.behaviors.interaction.click.subscribe(ev => {
		console.log(ev.current.repr?.theme.color);
	});
not every theme will work with this as some themes require 3D positions of vertices (most of the default ones work on the element locations)
