CUSTOM INTERACTIONS DEFINITION AND VISUALIZATION #979

POSITION OF RESIDUE WHEN HOVERING
this.plugin.behaviors.interaction.hover.subscribe(ev => {
    if (StructureElement.Loci.is(ev.current.loci)) {
        const l = StructureElement.Loci.getFirstLocation(ev.current.loci);
        if (l) {
            const seq_id = StructureProperties.residue.label_seq_id(l);
        }
    }
});
You can use StructureElement.Loci.forEachLocation() to iterate over all the hovered locations too.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOLECULES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES #81
create a structure object based on multiple models. In this case the interaction should be computed automatically
	use the StructureFromTrajectory transform while creating a signle trajectory from multiple models
		https://github.com/molstar/molstar/blob/master/src/mol-plugin-state/actions/structure.ts#L138
		(or write a custom transform that composes multiple models)
	then there is a special "interactions visual"
OR
write a custom visual that takes the structures as input
