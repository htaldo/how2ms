This repo is meant to be a compilation of notes from info found over on https://github.com/molstar/molstar.
I hope some of them eventually make it to the docs.

Every file has cross references to issues in github, marked with a hashtag (#).
  You can type https://github.com/molstar/molstar/issues/ and append the number of the issue.

The repo includes a script (fs) to find snippets/strings on the files.
  Dependencies: fzf, nvim (though you could easily change it to vim)
  Usage: ./fs . <string>
Make sure to do chmod +x!
