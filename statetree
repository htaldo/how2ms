The state tree was designed around the idea that the information needed (to update a node?) is contained in the props of a node and it uses react-like state reconciliation to update what is rendered.  #622

If you want custom visuals, you need to create a custom Representation that builds it and then a Transform, that adds it to the state tree.

example on how to build the state tree

SELECTQ AND HIERARCHY
You can query the state with plugin.state.data.selectQ. Maybe plugin.managers.structure.hierarchy.current/selection can help too. #454
SelectQ accesses the state tree rendered on the left side directly and allows you to manipulate it #970
	more about selectQ in selector

The hierarchy (plugin.managers.structure.hierarchy, also referred to as component manager in 578) is a mirror of the state tree that aggregates loaded trajectories/models/representations/etc. to make it easier to render specialized UI for it #970
Since the component manager is for UI purposes mostly and works as this kind of mirror, it gets updated asynchronously, which may cause timing issues when trying to extract loci from a component of a structure #578	


HIDE NODES FROM THE STATE TREE #899
You can use isGhost to hide a node from the state tree:
	this.plugin.builders.data.rawData{..., {state: { isGhost: true }})
it is also possible to do this with just one subtree, but you would have to write your own custom transforms for that
