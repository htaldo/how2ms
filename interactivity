behavior: highlight, select
focus: the focus representation shows a Loci in ball-and-stick representation and, additionally, visualizes non-covaent	interactions between atoms of the Loci as well as interactions with surrounding residues (default: 5A)
zoom can be applied to loci too
neither focus nor zoom are elements of interactivity
