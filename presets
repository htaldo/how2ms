HIERARCHY PRESET #970
The hierarchy preset loads the model and structure, so there's no need to do it manually

REPRESENTATION PRESET #970
if you already loaded the model via the preset, you can just use the representation preset(?)
	this.plugin.builders.structure.representation.applyPreset(structure, ...)
