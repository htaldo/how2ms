both hierarchy-preset and representation preset-can be found on mol-plugin-state/builder/structure/hierarchy-preset.ts

the (hierarchy) applyPreset function returns a dictionary with references #985

DEFAULT REPRESENTATION PRESET #1033
DefaultRepresentationPreset
In this preset, water is added by default. If you want to skip waters by default, you'll have to write your own custom preset #477

ALL-MODELS #1033
preset-trajectory-all-models loads representations for all models from a file with the nav buttons

HIERARCHY PRESET
The hierarchy preset loads the model and structure, so there's no need to do it manually #970

	TRAJECTORY PRESET
	to apply a trajectory preset, you might want to use "default" instead of "all-models", since "all models" will add every single model of the trajectory to the state tree, instead of having just one model for the whole trajectory #282
		await plugin.builders.structure.hierarchy.applyPreset(trajectory, 'default');
	

REPRESENTATION PRESET #970
if you already loaded the model via the preset, you can just use the representation preset(?)
	this.plugin.builders.structure.representation.applyPreset(structure, ...)

	PLDDT PRESET
	pLDDT is a representation preset, not a hierarchy preset, so it is invoked as follows #925
		await plugin.builders.structure.representation.applyPreset(struct, QualityAssessmentPLDDTPreset.id as any);

	POLYMER AND LIGAND
	the polymerAndLigand preset is an example of how the state tree is built by default for PDB files #1050

	STRUCTURE PROPERTIES PRESET #144

DEFINING A PRESET
presets can be defined via the StructureRepresentationPresetProvider class (for representation presets)

docking-viewer/viewport.tsx

EXTRA
more about presets in loadstructures
ViewerAutoPreset is registered before the UI renders. Otherwise the structure representation won't be automatically update after download #978
